**DESIGN SYSTEM VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:**

**1. COMPONENT CONSISTENCY & REUSABILITY**
- Evaluate component usage patterns and consistency
- Assess design token implementation (colors, typography, spacing)
- Review component state variations and behaviors
- Analyze component composition and flexibility
- Check atomic design principle adherence

**2. BRAND GUIDELINE COMPLIANCE**
- Evaluate brand color palette implementation
- Assess typography system consistency
- Review logo usage and brand mark application
- Analyze voice and tone consistency across components
- Check brand photography and illustration guidelines

**3. SCALABILITY & MAINTAINABILITY**
- Assess component library organization and structure
- Evaluate naming conventions and documentation quality
- Review component versioning and update processes
- Analyze design debt and inconsistency accumulation
- Check cross-platform component adaptation

**4. DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE & IMPLEMENTATION**
- Evaluate design-to-code handoff efficiency
- Assess component API design and flexibility
- Review accessibility implementation in components
- Analyze performance implications of component usage
- Check testing and validation processes

**5. USER EXPERIENCE CONSISTENCY**
- Evaluate user mental model consistency
- Assess interaction pattern standardization
- Review micro-interaction and animation consistency
- Analyze error handling and feedback patterns
- Check responsive behavior consistency

**6. GOVERNANCE & ADOPTION**
- Assess design system adoption across teams
- Evaluate contribution and feedback processes
- Review design system documentation effectiveness
- Analyze training and onboarding processes
- Check metrics and success measurement

**CONTEXT INTEGRATION:**
If design system documentation, brand guidelines, or component library information is provided, evaluate adherence and suggest optimizations.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Design System Health Scorecard
- Component Consistency Analysis
- Brand Compliance Assessment
- Scalability Improvement Plan
- Developer Experience Optimization
- Governance Process Recommendations
- Implementation Roadmap

Focus on improving system consistency while enhancing user experience and developer productivity.`
