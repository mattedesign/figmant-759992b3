**A/B TESTING STRATEGY FRAMEWORK:**

**1. HYPOTHESIS GENERATION**
- Identify high-impact testing opportunities
- Generate specific, measurable hypotheses
- Evaluate potential impact vs. effort
- Prioritize tests by expected lift potential
- Consider statistical power requirements

**2. TEST DESIGN STRATEGY**
- Define primary and secondary success metrics
- Identify variable isolation opportunities
- Suggest test duration and sample size needs
- Evaluate seasonal or temporal considerations
- Plan for statistical significance requirements

**3. CONVERSION FUNNEL TESTING**
- Map testing opportunities across user journey
- Identify high-drop-off points for testing
- Suggest micro-conversion optimization tests
- Evaluate multi-step funnel improvements
- Plan cohort and segment-specific tests

**4. DESIGN ELEMENT TESTING PRIORITIES**
- Headline and value proposition variations
- CTA button design, copy, and placement tests
- Color scheme and visual hierarchy experiments
- Layout and content organization tests
- Form design and field optimization tests

**5. ADVANCED TESTING CONCEPTS**
- Multivariate testing opportunities
- Personalization testing strategies
- Progressive optimization approaches
- Mobile-specific testing considerations
- Cross-device experience testing

**6. TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE**
- Recommend testing tools and setup
- Suggest tracking and analytics requirements
- Plan for result documentation
- Evaluate testing velocity optimization
- Consider technical implementation requirements

**CONTEXT INTEGRATION:**
If test hypotheses, current metrics, or business goals are provided, create specific testing recommendations aligned with those objectives.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Testing Opportunity Matrix
- High-Priority Hypothesis List
- Test Design Specifications
- Success Metrics Framework
- Testing Roadmap (90-day plan)
- Resource Requirements
- Expected Impact Projections

Focus on creating actionable, high-impact testing strategies with clear success criteria.`
